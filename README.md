## About this Notebook
This is a brief description of you, your Professor/PI, and your field of work.

### Organization and Use:
- Sections Groups: The notebook is divided into sections groups, each dedicated to a distinct research project with an associated number (e.g. a given Section Group would be numbered G__, and the 32nd section would be "G32: Descriptive Title of Section Group [DATE BEGUN]-> [PRESENT/DATE ENDED]"). The notebook as a whole, along with each Section Group, shall feature a dedicated table of contents for ease of navigation which shall be verified/updated whenever the notebook it is altered.
- Sections: Each Section within a Section Group is titled with a Section number (like Section Groups, the notation is "S__" : for example, the 32nd Section would be numbered "S32: Descriptive Title of Section"). Sections will be populated with descriptive subproject names.
- Pages: Each Page within a Section represents a particular day. Each Page is given a descriptive title and a date.
- Experiments: There may be more than one Experiment in each Page, or Experiments may span several days. For the purposes of this notebook, they will be numbered (as in E__, such as above: the 32nd Experiment would be given a bolded subheading in the Page of "E32: Descriptive Title of Experiment". In cases where Experiments span multiple days, they will be marked as such: "E032 (cont. from [PAGE]): Descriptive Title of Experiment".)
- Recording Format: Pages may utilize a combination of text, tables, diagrams, and screenshots to document work. Every step of the analysis is meticulously recorded, including:
  - Purpose: A description of the objective and past work, with references.
  - Protocol (Planned): An outline of the planned steps
  - Materials: A list of any data files or specific software packages needed
  - Protocol (Used): A record of all steps taken, planned and unplanned.
  - Data: A collection of the raw data collected during that day.
  - Results/Conclusions: A summary of findings or interpretations
  - Time Spent: The time spent during that day (clock-in/clock-out time), as tracked with the stopwatch feature within OneNote
  - Name (Signature) and Datetime: A formal certification of authenticity.
